# Skifree.js

This is a **work in progress** port of the popular 1991 PC game [Skifree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree).

I just started work this Christmas 2012 so I've not done a whole lot yet. So far you can just sort of ski down a never-ending skislope with a few trees which do not yet have transparent backgrounds. Nor does your character.

## So, what's left to do?

This is what I'm gonna do, probably in this order. Who the hell knows. There are other features to the original game but I'm not going to add them to the list until I've gotten through this one.

* Collision detection
* Crashing into little trees
* Distance tracking
* Rainbow jump platforms & jumping
* Big trees & crashing into them both whilst skiing and jumping
* Rocks
* Snowboarders

Some features which weren't in the original which I'd like to give a go:

* Being a snowboarder instead of a boring old skier
* Tricks, or something?

## F*ck this, let me play the game goddammit

* Open up index.html in Chrome, or maybe even Firefox - I haven't tested it in anything but Chrome 23.0 yet, and I probably won't I'm afraid
* Go.

## This is pretty frickin' sweet but it's clearly not finished. I can totally improve it. Let me improve it, dammit.

* Make a pull request with your awesome additions.
* Maybe raise an issue?
